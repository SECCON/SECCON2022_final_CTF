    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>
    This problem is designed to give you a lot of questions, and the content is to answer as many of them correctly as possible.
    Some problems have over 100,000 questions.
    </p>

    <p>
    In principle, questions are done by comparing arrays, and one point is awarded for a match between the array index and the value.
    For example, if the correct ans The scoring instructions for the questions can be downloaded as source code from each question page. for example, the answer is <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code> and you submit <code>[1,1,1,1,5]</code>, you will receive 2 points.
    However, there are exceptions.
    There are cases where you get 0 points if you make a mistake in a specific number, and there are also problems where points are gained after a certain amount of time has passed.
    See the source code for each issue for details.
    </p>

    <p>
    The scoring instructions for the questions can be downloaded as source code from each question page.
    </p>

    <h5> main points of this page </h5>
    <ol>
      <li> You can only submit once in 1 tick (5 seconds) </li>
      <li> There is a problem with different answers every tick</li> 
      <li> Some requests may not return for several seconds. Despite our best efforts, there is no compensation for missed ticks due to unreturned requests. ((DO NOT DoS)) </li>
      <li> If you miss a tick, you can specify a past tick and submit it. (There is a 5 second submission limit) </li>
      <li> For each stage, KoH score will be calculated by the highest score per 5 minutes </li>
      <li> KoH scores are determined only by rank. Rank is determined solely by the number of points earned in a stage. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> What's <i> Stage? </i> </h2>
    <p>
    There will be a total of 4 questions.
    The problems are called  <i> STAGE </i>  and range STAGE1~STAGE4.
    Each question will not be posed in parallel at the same time.
    </p>

    <h2> How are KoH scores calculated? / What's <i> Round? </i> </h2>
    <p>
    Every 5 minutes, the score is calculated based on the <b> highest score </b> at that point in time at <b> the stage being held </b>.
    This unit of progress every 5 minutes is <i> round </i>.
    In other words, when stage2 is being held, the score is calculated every 5 minutes based on the highest score at that time in stage2.

    <p>
    <b> The Koh score differs from the question score (number of correct answers).</b>
    KoH scores are determined by the rank order of scores per 5 minutes.
    The rankings and KoH points are as follows.
    Even if you score 100,000 points, if you are in first place, you get 20 points for that round.

    <h2> What's <i>tick?</i> </h2>
    <p>
    You can only answer a question once every 5 seconds.
    This 5-second unit is the <i> tick </i>.
    Thus, one round is 60 ticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>There is a problem where the correct answer changes with each tick.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, <code> [1,2,3,4,5] </code> <b>in tick 1 </b> of stage 1 may become <code> [2,3,4,5,6] </code> <b>in tick 2</b> of stage1.
    </p>

    <p>
    How it changes at each tick is specified in the source code distributed at each stage.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b> Each tick can be submitted once </b>, and can also be submitted as a past tick by specifying it in the request.
    </p>

    <h2> How To Submit? </h2>
    You can submit the following source code.
    <p>
      note: You cannot check the content of the submission, so please manage it yourself.
    </p>
